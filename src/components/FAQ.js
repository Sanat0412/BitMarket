                <strong>Coin Price</strong> refers to the current global
                volume-weighted average price of a cryptoasset traded on an
                active cryptoasset exchange as tracked by CoinGecko.
                <br /> <strong>Market Capitalization</strong> is one of the
                metrics used to measure the relative size of a cryptoasset.
                Market Capitalization is calculated by multiplying Coin Price
                with Available Supply.
                <br /> <strong>Volume</strong> is the total trading volume of a
                cryptoasset across all active cryptoasset exchanges tracked by
                CoinGecko.

                U.S. dollar, central bank digital currencies, privacy coins

                owners the right to vote in decisions regarding blockchainâ€™s
                future development), utility tokens, and non-fungible tokens

                Since cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized network that
                lacks a central authority, it is possible to exchange
                cryptocurrency without registering an identity. Yes, since the
                start there have been criminal activities with cryptocurrencies.
                However, the blockchain publicly records every transaction, and
                while names are not assigned to addresses, you can trace
                activity back to a crypto exchange, which knows the end user.
                The estimates vary for how many transactions are for illegal
                activities and proponents of cryptocurrency point to illegal
                activity with traditional currencies. (Source: NY Times article
